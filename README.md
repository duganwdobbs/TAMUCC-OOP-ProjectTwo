# TAMUCC-OOP-ProjectTwo; Library GUI.

This project is to develop a frontend for a Library that allows already registered users to check in / out books using a RFID reader / writer.
<br>
The goal is to provide users with faster access than through a station at the front of the library.
<br>
This is a proof of concept using a barcode scanner, in reality the RFID chips could be embedded in the spine of the book, and have information as to if it is checked out, who checked it out, ect ect.
